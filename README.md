# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (Multiple Linear Regression)

This is small experient of predicting the prices of the house in Delhi
Trying to find the key driving features for the prediction of the price of the house

It's for beginner's who just started learning machine learning  and trying to build their first machine learning model with the help of Multipe Linear Regression 

You can go through this blog if you want read more about it  [link of the blog by Towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-on-boston-housing-dataset-f409b7e4a155)

We use both Statsmodels as well Sklearn libraries to build the model.
We used statsmodel only because statsmodel offer's a very good function known as summary , with the help of summary we can see the whole summary of the model at a single place with the singe line of code and based on that summary we will evaluate our model
